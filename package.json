  "description": "A small passion project which combines English as a Second Language (Yes/No question practice) with Magic Eight Ball. It's designed to be used in the classroom. Teachers can show it to the class, practice submitting fun Y/N questions, and then get a Magic response. I'm coding this using a MERN stack, but likely will not need MongoDB (unless I decide to get fancy). I will probably deploy on heroku.  ",
